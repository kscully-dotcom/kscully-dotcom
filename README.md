👋 Hi, I’m Kristin Scully. I am an Economist, Data Scientist, Python Developer, Front-End Web Developer, Data Engineer, Wife, and Cat Mom.

👀 I’m interested in Data Science, Data Engineering, and developing software applications!

🌱 I’m currently learning Big Data Clustering programs such as Hadoop and other MapReduce tools. 
     I am a year into my Master of Computer Science in Data Science at Regis University.
     I have multiple Python Developed programs for building and automating reports. 

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Software Development tools for Data Analytics and improving UIs for you and your clients!

📫 You can reach me at kscully001@regis.edu. Email for phone information.

⚠ Many of my projects are in private mode because they are either under construction, top-secret, or simply homework 🤫

Comeback later and I will have some public projects.
